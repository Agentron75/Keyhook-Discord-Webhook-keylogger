Tutorial

1. Open Discord / log in to your account.  
2. Select the server where you are the owner in / where you want to create a webhook.  
3. Right-click the desired text channel and click Edit Channel or the gear icon.  
4. Go to Integrations > Webhooks.  
5. Click Create Webhook.  
6. Optional : Customize the webhook (name, avatar, and channel).  
7. Click Copy Webhook URL. 
8. Save your webhook by clicking Save Changes.
9. Open Keyhook.py in Visual Studio Code, go to line 7
and replace 'Your webhook here' with your actual Discord webhook URL you copied from earlier.
10. The code will work and send it to your webhook (in the channel)

MISC:
You can modify delay seconds in line 42 by replacing 10 with your choice. I put 10 so it sends every 10 seconds.
